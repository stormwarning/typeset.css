`Typeset.css` helps inform your typographic choices, without dictating—as much as possible—your visual design.

Without the excellent work of others, this wouldn’t have been possible:
- [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/)
- [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss)
- [normalize-opentype.css](https://github.com/kennethormandy/normalize-opentype.css)
- [dodging-bullets](https://github.com/kennethormandy/dodging-bullets)
- [Typographic](https://github.com/corysimmons/typographic)
